What is Ollama?
Ollama is a program that can run on a local computer and can be used to manage and work with large language models. Ollama serves the following main functions
1. Allows one to manage and switch between various open source LLMs
2. Runs the models locally on the host computer and allows for interacting with them either through the command line interface or programatically via APIs
3. It provides a unified interface for working with different models from various sources, hence serving as an abstraction layer between the models themselves and the applications that use them

How to use Ollama?
Ollama runs as a server on the local computer. Before we can start working with Ollama, we need to start the program
`ollama serve`
